title: 'About the Redesign'
---

This is a short (kind of off-topic) post about the redesign I did on here. It will feature nothing technical or educational, just some of the thoughts behind the redesign. I will first talk about the goals I had and then explain what I did with each one.

## Goals

I had a couple of things in mind that I wanted to do which made me think about redesigning in the first place. The first and most important to me was that I wanted to give the posts a more clean and minimalistic look and feel. The second was that I wanted to write a CV and display it on my website. I had no particular reason I wanted to do so, but I did anyway :)

## Minimalism

Minimalism is obviously a big trend in design now and lots of people swear by it. I am no different. I love the feel of simple and whitespace-y websites which really let the content pop out ever so subtley.

I made a few styling changes to acheive a more minimal feel, the most noticable being the banner on the left (or top, depends what device you're on).

Instead of having a photo of myself and a the description carousel on all the pages, I left only my name, a short sentence about myself and links to various social networks and put everything else on the new home page.

Here is a quick reminder of how the index page used to look:

## CV

I really wanted to have a nice CV on here so I wrote one up and styled it a bit. It can be found [here](/cv.html) and is also linked to from the home page. I don't really need a CV as I am not looking for a job at the moment, but I thought it would be nice to have one anyway.

## That's It

I am really pleased with the way it came out, I hope I'm not the only one. As always, comments, tips, questions and everything are welcome and appreciated. Good day.
