title: 'PAQ: Possibly Asked Questions'
---

For my first blog post ever, I will answer some questions about myself and this blog which I think you might be asking yourself. If you have any more, as always, feel free to contact me on any one of my social profiles linked on this page or via email at assaf.gelber@gmail.com!



## Who are you again..?

As I assume you have figured out already, my name is Assaf Gelber. I am a 20 year old Israeli developer and designer. I also love to play poker (although I only play recreationally, not professionally), drink beer and more.

## What do you do?

I started programming in highschool (3 years ago), where I was taught ASP.NET web development and a bit of Java. Since then I have completely abandoned those two and learned python, ruby, javascript and CSS by myself. I am extremely passionate about web development as well as UI and UX design. I mostly work with ruby on rails but have also done quite a bit of python programming and I can spend hours playing around with javascript and CSS. I am always learning new technologies and improving the skills I have.

## How did you get this blog up?

This blog is written using the [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) framework along with [Haml](http://haml.info) and [Sass](http://sass-lang.com)	and is hosted using Github Pages. I will write a whole post soon explaining more thoroughly how I got everything running.

_**Edit:** Post can be found [right here](/jekyll-haml-sass-on-github-pages/)_

## What will you be writing about?

The purpose of this blog is to teach what I know and through that learn more, so I will mostly be writing about web development and design with some tutorials here and there. My goal is that this blog will serve as a resource to other developers.

## Anything else?

That is all, I think. I will try to have new content up frequently so check back once in a while to see if there's anything new. Plus, feedback is **very much appreciated** so please feel free to let me know what you think on [twitter](https://twitter.com/assafgelber) or via email at assaf.gelber@gmail.com. Thanks!
