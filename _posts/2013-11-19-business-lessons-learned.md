title: '3 Startup Lessons Learned So Far'
---

I have been working on [Stylift](http://www.stylift.com), a personalized fashion discovery and shopping experience, with 2 kick-ass co-founders for the past 2.5 months, and other than having loads of fun building the product I have learned from them some invaluable lessons in the business aspects of running a startup company, which I would like to share with you.

As we are at a pretty early stage, all of these lessons are about finding potential investors and reaching out to them.

## 1. Be patient, but persistent

Not every email you send will be answered the next day, not even the next week. Don't let this faze you. Whether it be an accelerator, a VC or an angel investor, they probably receive dozens of emails a day. If you are good enough, they will get back to you eventually, even if it means sending 4 reminders.

## 2. Don't hesitate to approach anyone

A lot of the meetings we've set up with angel investors and advisors were by approaching people we recognized in parties, restaurants or just walking down the street. Every successful entrepreneur will love to hear about your idea and the possibility of joining your venture, don't be afraid to bug them if you see them, it really kick-starts your relationship on a more personal note rather than sending an email and hoping to hear back.

## 3. Feel free to decline offers

I was amazed, at first, to hear from one of the co-founders that we declined a big offer from an angel investor. I couldn't grasp that someone was willing to give us such a big sum of money and we refused to accept it. But it was an excellent decision. There are always people trying to cash in on young startups and bring no value to the company or even worse, become an obstacle on your way to build your company. Try to avoid these people, even if it means having to keep looking for funding elsewhere.
