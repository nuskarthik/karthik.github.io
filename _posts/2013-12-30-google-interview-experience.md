title: 'My Interview Experience at Google'
---

During the last few weeks, I got the chance to go through some steps of the interview process at Google for a Senior Web Engineer position at Waze. I went through 4 out of 6 interviews, so I wanted to write a short post describing what went down and how for those who are going to interview or are just interested to know what it's like.

## Initial Contact

I am not looking for a job at the moment since I only finish my mandatory military service in July, so first contact about this position was made by Google. A technical sourcer from Google London, sent me an email, saying that he came across my blog and would like to have a chat about the opportunity of working at Google as they are looking to expand the Waze web team. I was very excited to get the opportunity to go through Google's infamous recruiting process, so we scheduled a phone call for the next day.

On the phone I told the him all about myself and my work experience, and he told me exactly what they are looking for and what the process will be like. He explained that he will give all the information about me to a recruiter from Google Tel-Aviv, with whom I will have another phone call like this one, then, a phone call with the web team leader at Waze. Depending on his decision, I will then have a day of on-site interviews, and then it is up to the guys at Waze to decide the next steps.

He was very professional and kind, both in the email conversions we had and on the phone, and stayed in close contact with me until I started the next stage. 

## Local Recruiter

A couple of days went by before I got a call from the recruiter which was almost identical to the conversation with the sourcer - I talked about myself, she told me what to expect in the next steps, and, with the help of a recruiting coordinator, we scheduled a phone call with the Waze web team leader for the next week.

## First Sign of Tech

For this call, a shared Google Doc for the interviewer and myself, was set up in advance and I was instructed to have it open in front of me for the interview because the interviewer might like give me some challenges to solve.

Our conversation had 3 parts. 

The first, just like the first two calls was all about me and what I do. 

The second part was the first time during this process that I was somewhat tested about my technical knowledge. It wasn't a practical test of engineering skills but more of a trying to understand if I really know what I'm taking about kind of thing. The interviewer asked which technologies I use at Stylift and for each one, asked why I chose that one over the alternatives, for example, why Rails over Node.js, or why SASS and not just vanilla CSS. It was nice to finally start talking about technology, but I was still eagerly waiting for some of the famous Google challenges.

Part 3, was all about the position itself. I was told all about what the web team's responsibility is at Waze and what exactly I would be doing there. I have to say that Waze sounds like an awesome place to work both because of what the interviewer told and because of the interviewer himself who sounded like a great guy, personally and professionally.

## On-site

A few more stressful days went by and I got another email from my recruiter, saying that the phone interview went great, and that the team would be glad to meet me on-site for another interview. So again, with the help of the coordinator, we scheduled an interview for later that week.

Once there, I met up with one of the members of the web team who would be interviewing me that day. Once more, the first part of the interview, was me jabbering about myself, but then I was finally given a white-board and a marker and was asked some real programming questions.

I was given time to answer each question and then we discussed my answer, why I did it that way, how it could have been solved differently and so on. The challenges I was given were:

* Given a ruby array of numbers, calculate the average of the numbers in the array, with the help of Enumerable#inject.

* Using the a DevTools console only (can't change actual code), how would you log every call to Array#push in Javascript?

* Write a Javscript function, which takes a function and returns that same function with the constraint that it can only be executed once.

I was fairly surprised by the skill-level of these questions, I had expected for it to by much higher, but was pleased that everything went very smooth.

## What Would've Been Next

About 10 nerve-racking days later, I got a call from my recruiter saying that the team said the interview went well, but they are looking for someone with more experience for this position, so I will not be continuing with the next steps of the process.

If I had passed on the next step, I was told that I would receive a very small project to complete at home, which I thought was a better way to filter out candidates than the white-board programming, and lastly, a short interview with the 2 founders of Waze, now the CEO and CTO.

## Conclusion

I believe the actual technical reviewing process could be done better. I do think the fact that each candidate receives a project to do at home is excellent, but the writing code on a white-board part - not so much.

I think the part which I appreciate most is that a couple of weeks after I was done, I was asked to fill out a 10 minute survey about the whole recruiting process.

I was disappointed not to get the job, obviously, but I did have a nice experience during the process and most importantly, I got a Waze t-shirt.
