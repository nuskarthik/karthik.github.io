title: 'My Public Speaking Debut'

This post is also not exactly educational, but more of an invitation to the event which will host my first ever public talk!

## Whitespace In Production

My public speaking debut will occur this week, as part of the [Ignite TLV](http://www.meetup.com/Ignite-TLV/) event occuring on the 19th of November! I will be doing a 5 minute talk about whitespace in web design (I hope at least some of you got the joke). I hope I will have a video to put up for those who will not be able to make it.

## Ignite Talks

For those who aren't familiar with the Ignite Talk format (I have to admit that I wasn't until not too long ago), Ignite Talks, started by Brady Forrest and Bre Pettis, are lightning talks which consist of 20 slides which auto-advance every 15 seconds. Specifically in Ignite TLV, the topics mostly revolve around technology and entrepreneurship.

Ignite events are always very mind-opening and inspiring, if you've never been to one, I strongly suggest you try sometime.

Wish me luck!
